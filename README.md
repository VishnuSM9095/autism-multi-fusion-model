our project aims to develop a multimodal fusion model for autism diagnosis for identification of Autism type by integrating  EEG signals, behavioral datasets and MRI scans. The approach leverages machine learning models  for classification and incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP to enhance interpretability and model comparison.

Dataset Used:
ABIDE - MRI dataset 
DREAM - EEG dataset 
AUTISM ADULT SCREENING - behavioural dataset

Machine learning models used:
Stack generalization
CNN + XGBoostGBM 
Random Forest + SVM
GBM+LogisticÂ Regression
